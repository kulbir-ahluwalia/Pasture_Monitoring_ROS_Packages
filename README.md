# Pasture_Monitoring_ROS_Packages

Please add the toplevel.cmake file in the path:
```
/opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake

```

All the scripts have been originally developed by Harnaik Singh Dhami, PhD student in CS, University of Maryland. They were later modified for use in Ubuntu 18 and for Pasture Monitoring in simulated environments such as Gazebo.
